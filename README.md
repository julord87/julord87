# Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianmzg/">Julian<a/>! 👋 </br> <b>a Fullstack Developer 🤖</b>

## About Me 🚀
I was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. I'm passionate about programming 💻, music 🎵, and sports. 

In the world of programming, I work independently, excelling in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (my favorite), React, Next.js, NodeJS, SCSS, Git, and Github. I enjoy the intellectual challenge that programming presents and stand out for my creativity, teamwork, and attention to detail. Colleagues appreciate my sense of humor, empathy, and discipline.

With over a decade of experience, I've composed six musical albums and produced more than ten. As a technical event producer, I've coordinated the production of notable events, including the Buenos Aires Pride March, various festivals, programs, and TV broadcasts 📺 throughout Argentina.

Additionally, as a recreational boxer 🥊, I find in this sport a source of energy and balance. I'm excited to continue contributing to the worlds of music and technology.

Let's connect! 🚀
